Hi, I am working with TYPO3 CMS, and I have encountered an exception in my code.
The exception message reads as follows:

{exceptionClass}: "{exception.message -> f:format.raw()}"
<f:if condition="{exception.file}">in {exception.file}
{f:if(condition: exception.line, then: 'on line {exception.line}')}</f:if>

Here's the code snippet with line numbers where the exception occurred:

{snippet -> f:format.raw()}

Please note that this TYPO3 CMS installation is in {mode} mode and using
version {typo3Version}. The PHP version being used is {phpVersion}.

Please provide a solution that is efficient, effective, and robust, enabling the
TYPO3 CMS installation to function smoothly and without errors. Your response
