Hello, my good old friend. Nice to meet you again!

I have a problem in my TYPO3 CMS {typo3Version} installation, running in {mode} mode.
Can you please help me and provide a solution for the following exception message?

<f:if condition="{exception.file}">File: {exception.file}</f:if>
Exception: {exception.message -> f:format.raw()}
<f:if condition="{exception.line}">Line: {exception.line}</f:if>
<f:if condition="{snippet}">
Snippet including line numbers:
{snippet -> f:format.raw()}
</f:if>

Please answer in Markdown format. Thanks in advance!
