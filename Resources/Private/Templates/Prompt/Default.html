Hi, I am working with TYPO3 CMS and encountered an exception in my code.
The error message is:

{exceptionClass}: "{exception.message -> f:format.raw()}"
<f:if condition="{exception.file}">in {exception.file}
{f:if(condition: exception.line, then: 'on line {exception.line}')}</f:if>

Here is the relevant code snippet:

```php
{snippet -> f:format.raw()}
```

**Environment details:**

* TYPO3 CMS {typo3Version} ({mode})
* PHP {phpVersion}
{f:if(condition: dbVersion, then: '* {dbVersion}')}

**Task:**

Analyze the issue, identify the root cause, and provide a structured solution.
If multiple solutions exist, compare their trade-offs.

**Expected Response Format (Markdown):**

1. Issue Analysis – Explain the root cause.
2. Solution Steps – Provide step-by-step instructions.
3. Code Example – Ensure correctness and maintainability.
4. Additional Considerations – Mention alternative solutions if applicable

The solution should be efficient, maintainable, and production-ready.
Code snippets must be correct, readable, and well-commented.
