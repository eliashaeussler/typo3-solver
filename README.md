provides a console command to solve problems from command line.

## üíé Credits

The extension icon ("lightbulb-on") is a modified version of the original
[`actions-lightbulb-on`][2] icon from TYPO3 core. In addition, the icons
[`actions-calendar`][3], [`actions-cpu`][4], [`actions-debug`][5],
[`actions-exclamation-triangle-alt`][6] and [`spinner-circle`][7] from
TYPO3 core are used. All icons are originally licensed under [MIT License][8].

This project is highly inspired by the article [*Fix your Laravel exceptions with AI*][9]
by [Marcel Pociot][10].

In addition, I'd like to thank [Nuno Maduro][11] and all contributors
of the [`openai-php/client`][1] library for this beautiful piece of code.
